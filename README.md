# ScopingSim-ISD
2016_Spring_ScopingSim

ScopingSim is a medical simulator project currently being designed and developed by undergraduate students at the University of Pittsburgh School of Information Sciences (SIS).

Our Role:
To develop a web­based user interface that would allow medical educators to upload a video of a procedure (such as endoscopy, colonoscopy, etc...) and synchronize this video with movements of a simulated endoscope.

This web based interface must support the following functions:
● Uploading a video file
● Scrubbing a video (fast­forward and reverse) using a standard computer mouse
and the simulated endoscope
● Jump to a timeline on a video
